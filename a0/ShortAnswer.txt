1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 238 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?
We need to consider the total number of friends they have. In this example, Jill and Gary have 1645 and 3484 friends, respectively. However, Hillary and Donald only have 761 and 45 friends. So the percentage of similarity for Jill&Stein and Hillary&Donald are 238/(1645+3484) = 4% and 1/(761+45) = 0.1%, which is more reliable than previous method.



2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.

White house is followed by Hillary and Donald. Since Donald is the president now, administrates the whole USA and white house. Therefore, it’s really clear that Donald follows White house.
Hillary was first lady before. She also made twice presidential run, which means she needs to keep in touch with white house.




3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?

Since Donald doesn’t trust anyone except his family members, he has really fewer friends in the real world.
It will affect our analysis because the total number that Johnson and Donald follow are too less. It’ll be better if  







4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?
