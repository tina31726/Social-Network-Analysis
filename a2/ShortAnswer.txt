1. Looking at the top errors printed by get_top_misclassified, name two ways you would modify your classifier to improve accuracy (it could be features, tokenization, or something else.)

a.Enlarge lexicon dataset from AFINN data
b.Change penalty parameter in LogisticRegression from l2 to l1






2. Implement one of the above methods. How did it affect the results?
I implement a method in a2_ShortAnswer.py file and there are three step below :
I download AFINN data and classify each lexicon into positive or negative list. I also change min_freq in best_result from 5 to 2 when doing fit_best_classifier,
finally the accuracy is growing up from 0.73 to 0,7475
